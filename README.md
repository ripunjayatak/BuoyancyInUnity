# BuoyancyInUnity

This is the game physics assignment in which I tried to demonstrate the Buoyancy physics.
I have created a small advertisment copy in unity following with the explanation and implementation video.
I have also uploaded the scripts which I used in developing the scene in Unity Engine.

This comes under our syllabus at VIT-Bhopal.

This is the link where I explained the concept of buoyancy - https://youtu.be/_bXAn2pVLaM
